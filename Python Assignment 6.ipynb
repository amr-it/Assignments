    "\n",
    "5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?\n",

    "\n",
    "'e'\n",

    "'There-can-only-one.'\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the methods for right-justifying, left-justifying, and centering a string?\n",
    "\n",
    "rjust(), ljust() and center() are the methods used for right-justifying, left-justifying, and centering a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the best way to remove whitespace characters from the start or end?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the .strip() method to remove whitespace and characters from the beginning and the end of a string. But, you can use lstrip() or rstrip() methods to remove whitespace from left and right ends of a string, respectively.\n"
