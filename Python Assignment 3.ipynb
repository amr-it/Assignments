    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python. You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. That means that a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Function runs once it's referenced. Hence, once a function is called, then, code inside it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you define a function with the def keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon. The next thing you have to do is make sure you indent with a tab or 4 spaces, and then specify what you want the function to do for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Function is a set of instructions that can be used repeatedly, whereas, to \"call\" means to make a reference in your code to a function that is written elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is 1 global scope in Python, while, local scopes are created every time you call a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters and names that you assign inside a function exist only within the function or local scope associated with the function call. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed and the names are forgotten. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python return statement is a special statement that you can use inside a function or method to send the functionâ€™s result back to the caller. \n",
    "Return can only be used inside a function. For Example, return 3+4 outside of a function/class will give syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't explicitly use a return value in a return statement, or if you totally omit the return statement, then Python will implicitly return a default value which will always be None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all.  None is a data type of its own (NoneType).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the import keyword to make code in one module available in another. Therefore, the above statement will import the module areallyourpetsnamederic to your current module.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the functions inside a module by using a dot(.) operator along with the module name. Therefore, use the following\n",
    "\n",
    "areallyourpetsnamederic.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Exception Handling & Logging as a best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error."
