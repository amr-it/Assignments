    "List is created using []\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    "bacon looks like [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99] after this.\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator for list concatenation is + and for list replication is *.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "While append() will add values to the end of list, insert() will add value anywhere in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "The del statement & the remove() list method are 2 ways for removing items from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, can be used in for loops, be concatinated or replicated and be used with the in and not in operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable, they can have values added, removed or changed. Tuples are immutable, they can't be changed at all. Syntax-wise, tuples are written using parentheses, while, list uses square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "(42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use tuple() and list() functions respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that 'contain' list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "They contain references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "The  copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while, the copy.deepcopy() function will do deep copy of a list. Therefore, only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list."
